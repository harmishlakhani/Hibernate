Hibernate
=========

This repo contains hands on on basics of hibernate(date persistence framework) for J2EE

I will create simple POC for some basic CRUD(create, read, update and delete) operations and how hibernate will interact with database.

Here I am using Oracle 11g express edition as a DB. You can use your own chosen DB.

Required Tools/Jars:
1. Download latest hibernate distribution zip file from http://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/
2. Download the JDBC driver for Oracle 11g from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html
3. Last but not least you need JDK and IDE(Eclipse if you love :P).

It contains POCs according to classification like insert, update , delete and based on Annotaions as well.

Happy coding.
